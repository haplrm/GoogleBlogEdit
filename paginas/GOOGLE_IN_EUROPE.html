			<p>Tech entrepreneurs are changing the world through their own creativity and passion. To celebrate Europe’s thriving entrepreneurial scene and honor the most promising tech companies, in 2016 we founded the Digital Top 50 Awards, in association with McKinsey and Rocket Internet. The 2018 edition of the awards are now open for applications.</p>


           <p>Now in their second year, the awards are organized, once again, under the patronage of Mr. Carlos Moedas, Member of the European Commission, and supported by strategic partners INSEAD, Ashoka and Tech Open Air. Companies with a digital product or service from the EU and from EFTA countries can apply on the Digital Top 50 website until April 1, 2018.</p>


           <p>All top 50 companies will receive free tickets and showcase space at Tech Open Berlin on June 20-21 2018, where the final winners in each category will be announced. The winner in the Tech for Social Impact category will be granted a cash prize of 50,000 euros, and all five winners will be provided with support from the founding partners to scale their businesses further—through leading professional advice, structured consulting and coaching programs, as well as access to a huge network of relevant industry contacts.</p>
